## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge helped me learn how to continually improve my flexbox skills, and it greatly enhanced my understanding of grid layout and root elements. It was the first time I used grid layout and root elements in my project.

### Continued development

I believe I need to continually enhance my flexbox and grid layout skills, and I should aim to create more concise code for media queries.

### Useful resources
